SECURITY NOTES

Goal of ParDiff VPN system is to be generic and easy to
use/configure. *ParDiff VPN is not designed to be secure.*

Risk issue includes all users' passwords are stored as clear text in
database. This is because pptp CHAP requires password to be known both
at server side and client side.
